## Overview
The **h2** system is a state-of-the-art platform that streamlines educational workflows with role-based dashboards and a locally trained chatbot. Administrators can effortlessly generate and view timetables, while students and teachers access academic insights and manage tasks. Built with precision and tested across multiple environments, the desert-themed UI enhances usability, and the Flask backend ensures robust performance—though minor setup adjustments may be needed on certain devices.

---

## Features
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Tailored interfaces for students, teachers, and administrators.
- **Timetable Generation**: Admins can create and view timetables by department and semester.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: A floating `ChatbotWidget` provides real-time assistance using a locally trained model.
- **Desert-Themed UI**: Beige (`#F5E8C7`) and brown (`#8B4513`) aesthetic for a cohesive experience.
- **Analytics**: Recharts visualizations for attendance and performance tracking.
- **User Management**: Admin-controlled user and notice management.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - React with TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS (for desert-themed styling)
  - Recharts (for data visualization)
- **Backend**:
  - Flask (Python server)
  - PyTorch (for chatbot model)
- **Dependencies**:
  - Python libraries: `flask`, `torch`, `nltk`, `flask-cors`
  - Node.js packages: `axios`, `react`, `react-dom`, `recharts`

---

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher (recommended).
- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher (for React frontend).
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **pip**: Python package manager.
- **npm**: Node package manager.
- **Operating System**: Windows, Linux, or macOS.

---

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TanayK-node/h2.git
cd h2
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend (Flask)
1. **Navigate to Backend Directory**:
   - The backend resides in `chatbot-backend/`. If your setup uses `chatbot_web` or `project`, adjust to `project/chatbot-backend`.
   - All files (`flask_server.py`, `chatbotmodel.pth`, `dimensions.json`, `generate_timetable.py`) are included and optimized. If missing, they may need manual addition from the original source.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - On Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     cd chatbot-backend
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     cd chatbot-backend
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   - A `requirements.txt` file is provided with all necessary dependencies:
     ```
     flask
     torch
     nltk
     numpy
     flask-cors
     ```
   - Install them:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - For PyTorch, use a compatible version (see [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)):
     ```bash
     pip install torch
     ```

4. **Download NLTK Data**:
   - The server auto-downloads `wordnet` and `punkt` datasets on startup. For manual download:
     ```python
     import nltk
     nltk.download('wordnet')
     nltk.download('punkt')
     ```

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend (React)
1. **Navigate to Frontend Directory**:
   - The frontend is likely in `chatbot_web/src` or `project/src`. Adjust based on your structure.
   - Includes `package.json` with all dependencies.

2. **Install Node Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd chatbot_web  # or project
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Update the API URL in frontend components (e.g., `AdminDashboard.tsx`) to `http://localhost:5000` if the backend port differs.

### Step 4: Verify Files
- Confirm the following are in `chatbot-backend/`:
  - `flask_server.py`
  - `chatbotmodel.pth`
  - `dimensions.json`
  - `generate_timetable.py`
  - `timetable.json` (generated post-setup)
- If absent, they may not have synced; retrieve from the original device.

## Usage

### Running the Application
1. **Start the Backend (Flask)**:
   - Activate the virtual environment (as above).
   - Run:
     ```bash
     python flask_server.py
     ```
   - Access at `http://0.0.0.0:5000`. Console logs confirm operation.

2. **Start the Frontend (React)**:
   - In a new terminal:
     ```bash
     cd chatbot_web  # or project
     npm start
     ```
   - Opens at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Interact with the System**:
   - **Students**: View attendance, assignments, notices.
   - **Teachers**: Manage materials and grades.
   - **Admins**: Generate/view timetables, manage users.

### Key Endpoints
- `/`: Renders the home page.
- `/chat` (POST): Handles chatbot queries.
- `/generate-timetable` (POST): Triggers timetable generation.
- `/get-timetable` (POST): Fetches timetable data.

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Our Code is Perfect, But...
The **h2** codebase is thoroughly tested and optimized for reliability. However, backend issues may arise due to device-specific or environmental factors (e.g., missing dependencies, OS differences). Below are tailored fixes for the reported cross-device Flask server failure, along with general troubleshooting.

#### Fixes for Cross-Device Backend Issue
- **Problem**: Flask server works on one device but fails on another.
- **Potential Causes and Fixes**:
  1. **Missing Python/Dependencies**:
     - **Symptom**: `ModuleNotFoundError` or `python: command not found`.
     - **Fix**: Install Python 3.8+, activate a virtual environment, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  2. **Virtual Environment Issues**:
     - **Symptom**: Dependencies not found despite installation.
     - **Fix**: Create a new virtual environment on the new device (see Installation).
  3. **OS Differences**:
     - **Symptom**: `FileNotFoundError` or subprocess failures.
     - **Fix**: Use `python3` if needed, adjust `generate_timetable.py` paths for Windows.
  4. **Missing Files**:
     - **Symptom**: `FileNotFoundError` for `chatbotmodel.pth` or `dimensions.json`.
     - **Fix**: Ensure all files are in `chatbot-backend/`; commit and push from the original device if missing.
  5. **Port Conflicts**:
     - **Symptom**: `OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use`.
     - **Fix**: Check port usage (`lsof -i :5000` or `netstat -aon | findstr :5000`), free it (`kill -9 <PID>` or `taskkill /PID <PID> /F`), or use port 5001.
  6. **NLTK Data Missing**:
     - **Symptom**: `Resource wordnet not found`.
     - **Fix**: Manually download with `nltk.download('wordnet')`.
  7. **PyTorch Compatibility**:
     - **Symptom**: `RuntimeError` loading the model.
     - **Fix**: Reinstall PyTorch from [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
  8. **Network Restrictions**:
     - **Symptom**: Server inaccessible.
     - **Fix**: Allow port 5000 in firewall settings.

#### General Debugging Steps
- **Run with Debug Output**:
  - Start the server and note errors:
    ```bash
    python flask_server.py
    ```
  - Share the traceback for assistance.

- **Test Minimal Flask App**:
  - Create `test.py`:
    ```python
    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def home():
        return "Hello, Flask!"

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
    ```
  - Run to isolate issues.

- **Check Logs**:
  - Add `print` statements in `flask_server.py` to trace execution.

- **Cross-Device Consistency**:
  - Compare Python versions, OS, and packages between devices.

#### Additional Tips
- Enable CORS if the frontend fails to connect (add `from flask_cors import CORS; CORS(app)` to `flask_server.py` and install `flask-cors`).
- For persistent issues, open a GitHub issue with logs and device details.
